## Installation Instructions


### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Django 3.x or later


### Setup Steps
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Alx_DjangoLearnLab.git
   cd advanced_features_and_security
Run migrations to set up the database:

bash
python manage.py migrate

Create a superuser to access the admin panel:

bash
python manage.py createsuperuser

Start the development server:

bash
python manage.py runserver

Usage
Once the application is running, you can:

    Log in to the admin panel using the superuser credentials created during setup.
    Create user accounts and assign them to different groups (Editors, Viewers, Admins).
    Manage instances of MyModel based on assigned permissions.
        Editors can create and edit instances.
        Viewers can only view instances.
        Admins have full access to all functionalities.

Permissions and Groups
Custom Permissions
The following custom permissions are defined in the MyModel model:

    can_view: Allows viewing instances of MyModel.
    can_create: Allows creating new instances of MyModel.
    can_edit: Allows editing existing instances of MyModel.
    can_delete: Allows deleting instances of MyModel.

User Groups
The following groups have been created with specific permissions:

    Editors: Can create and edit instances (can_create, can_edit).
    Viewers: Can view instances (can_view).
    Admins: Have all permissions, including delete (can_view, can_create, can_edit, can_delete).

Users can be assigned to these groups via the Django admin interface, allowing for easy management of user roles.
Testing
To test the permission system:

    Create test users in the admin panel.
    Assign them to different groups (Editors, Viewers, Admins).
    Log in as these users and verify that they can only perform actions permitted by their assigned group.
        For example, a user in the Viewers group should be able to view instances but not create or edit them.
