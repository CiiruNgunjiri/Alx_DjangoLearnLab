Step 1: Define Custom Permissions in Models
First, you need to add custom permissions to your model. 

python
from django.db import models

class Book(models.Model):
    title = models.CharField(max_length=200)
    author = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    publication_year = models.IntegerField()
    id = models.AutoField(primary_key=True)

    class Meta:
        permissions = [
            ("can_view", "Can view book"),
            ("can_create", "Can create book"),
            ("can_delete", "Can delete book"),
            ("can_edit", "Can edit book"),
        ]


After defining your permissions, run the following commands to create and apply migrations:

bash
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate

Step 2: Create and Configure Groups with Assigned Permissions
Next, set up user groups and assign the newly created permissions using Django's admin interface.

    Create Groups:
        Navigate to the Django admin panel.
        Under Auth, select Groups.
        Click Add Group to create groups like Editors, Viewers, and Admins.
    Assign Permissions:
        For each group, assign appropriate permissions:
            Editors: can_edit, can_create
            Viewers: can_view
            Admins: All permissions (including can_delete)

You can also programmatically create groups and assign permissions as follows:

python
from django.contrib.auth.models import Group, Permission

# Create groups
editors_group, created = Group.objects.get_or_create(name='Editors')
viewers_group, created = Group.objects.get_or_create(name='Viewers')
admins_group, created = Group.objects.get_or_create(name='Admins')

# Assign permissions
editors_group.permissions.add(Permission.objects.get(codename='can_edit'))
editors_group.permissions.add(Permission.objects.get(codename='can_create'))
viewers_group.permissions.add(Permission.objects.get(codename='can_view'))
admins_group.permissions.add(Permission.objects.get(codename='can_delete'))

Step 3: Enforce Permissions in Views
Modify your views to check for these permissions before allowing users to perform certain actions. Use decorators such as @permission_required to enforce these permissions.
Example View Implementation

python
from django.contrib.auth.decorators import permission_required
from django.shortcuts import render, get_object_or_404
from .models import Book

@permission_required('bookshelf.can_view', raise_exception=True)
def article_detail(request, book_id):
    book = get_object_or_404(book, id=book_id)
    return render(request, 'book_detail.html', {'book': book})

@permission_required('bookshelf.can_create', raise_exception=True)
def create_article(request):
    # Logic for creating an article
    pass

@permission_required('app.can_edit', raise_exception=True)
def edit_article(request, article_id):
    # Logic for editing an article
    pass

@permission_required('app.can_delete', raise_exception=True)
def delete_article(request, article_id):
    # Logic for deleting an article
    pass

Step 4: Test Permissions
Manually test the implementation by assigning different users to groups and verifying that the permissions are enforced correctly.
Testing Approach

    Create test users in the Django admin panel.
    Assign them to different groups (e.g., Editor, Viewer).
    Log in as these users and attempt to access various parts of the application to ensure that permissions are applied correctly.

Step 5: Document the Setup
Provide a concise guide or notes within your code on how the permissions and groups are set up and used in the application. This can be done through comments or a README file.

# Permissions and Groups Setup

This Django application utilizes custom permissions for access control.

## Custom Permissions Defined:
- `can_view`: Allows viewing articles.
- `can_create`: Allows creating articles.
- `can_edit`: Allows editing articles.
- `can_delete`: Allows deleting articles.

## User Groups:
- **Editors**: Can create and edit articles.
- **Viewers**: Can only view articles.
- **Admins**: Full access (create, edit, view, delete).

## Usage:
Permissions are enforced in views using decorators like `@permission_required`. Ensure users are assigned to appropriate groups to access specific functionalities.
