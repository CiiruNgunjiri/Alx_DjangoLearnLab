### Technologies Used

    Django: A high-level Python web framework for building web applications.
    Django REST Framework: A powerful toolkit for building Web APIs in Django.
    Django Authtoken: For token-based authentication.
    Postman: For testing API endpoints.

Setup Process
Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:

    Python 3.x
    pip (Python package installer)

Step 1: Clone the Repository
Clone the project repository from GitHub:

bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Alx_DjangoLearnLab.git
cd social_media_api

Step 2: Install Dependencies
Install the required Python packages:

bash
pip install django djangorestframework djangorestframework-authtoken

Step 3: Configure the Project

    Database Migrations: Run migrations to set up the database:

bash
python manage.py migrate

Create a Superuser (optional for admin access):

    bash
    python manage.py createsuperuser

Step 4: Run the Development Server
Start the Django development server:

bash
python manage.py runserver

The API will be accessible at http://127.0.0.1:8000/.
User Registration and Authentication
User Registration
To register a new user via the HTML interface, navigate to /accounts/register/ and fill out the registration form. To register a new user via the API, send a POST request to /accounts/api/register/ with the following JSON payload:

json
{
    "username": "your_username",
    "email": "your_email@example.com",
    "password": "your_password"
}

Upon successful registration, a new user will be created in the database, and an authentication token will be generated.
User Login
To log in via the HTML interface, navigate to /accounts/login/ and fill out the login form. To log in via the API, send a POST request to /accounts/api/login/ with the following JSON payload:

json
{
    "username": "your_username",
    "password": "your_password"
}

If successful, you will receive an authentication token in response, which you can use for subsequent requests.
Token Authentication
Include the token in the Authorization header for protected routes:

text
Authorization: Token your_auth_token_here

User Model Overview
The custom user model CustomUser extends Djangoâ€™s AbstractUser and includes additional fields:

    username: Unique identifier for each user.
    email: User's email address.
    bio: A short biography of the user (optional).
    profile_picture: URL to the user's profile picture (optional).
    followers: A ManyToMany field that allows users to follow each other.
    phone_number: User's phone number (optional).
    designation: User's designation or title (optional).

Example User Model Code

python
from django.contrib.auth.models import AbstractUser
from django.db import models

class CustomUser(AbstractUser):
    bio = models.TextField(blank=True)
    profile_picture = models.ImageField(upload_to='profile_pics/', blank=True)
    followers = models.ManyToManyField('self', symmetrical=False, related_name='following', blank=True)
    phone_number = models.CharField(max_length=15, blank=True)  # Optional field
    designation = models.CharField(max_length=100, blank=True)   # Optional field

    class Meta:
        verbose_name = 'Custom User'
        verbose_name_plural = 'Custom Users'

    def __str__(self):
        return self.username  # or f"{self.username} ({self.designation})"
