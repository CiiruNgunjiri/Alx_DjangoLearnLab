### Overview of the Authentication System
This documentation provides a comprehensive overview of the authentication system, detailing its components, setup instructions, user interaction methods, and testing procedures.
Components of the Authentication System

### User Registration :
-Users can create an account by providing necessary information such as username, password, and email address.
-Passwords should be stored securely using hashing and salting techniques to protect against unauthorized access.
### User Login
    1. Users authenticate by entering their credentials (username and password).
    2. The system verifies these credentials against the stored data in the user database.
### Password Recovery
    -A mechanism is in place for users to reset their passwords if forgotten, typically involving email verification.
    -Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
    -For enhanced security, users may be required to provide an additional form of identification, such as a one-time code sent to their mobile device.
### Session Management
    -Once authenticated, sessions are created to maintain user login states, with secure session management practices to prevent session hijacking.

### Setup Instructions

    1. Environment Preparation
        -Ensure that your development environment includes necessary libraries and frameworks for authentication (e.g., Express.js for Node.js).
    2. Database Configuration
        -Set up a database (e.g., PostgreSQL, MongoDB) to store user credentials and session data.
        -Create tables/collections for users with fields for username, hashed password, email, and any additional metadata.
    3. Implementing Registration
        -Create a registration endpoint that accepts user data.
        -Validate input data and hash passwords before storing them in the database.
    4. Implementing Login Functionality
        -Develop a login endpoint that checks user credentials against the database.
        -Implement session creation upon successful authentication.
    5. Setting Up MFA
        -Integrate an MFA service (e.g., Google Authenticator) to send one-time codes during login.
    6. Secure Communication
        -Use HTTPS to encrypt data transmitted between clients and servers to protect sensitive information during authentication processes.

### User Interaction

    1. Registration Process:
        -Navigate to the registration page.
        -Fill out the registration form with required details.
        -Submit the form; upon success, users receive a confirmation email.
    2. Login Process:
        -Go to the login page.
        -Enter your username and password.
        -If MFA is enabled, input the one-time code sent to your registered device.
        -Successful login redirects users to their dashboard.
    3. Password Recovery:
        -Click on "Forgot Password" on the login page.
        -Enter your registered email address.
        -Follow instructions in the recovery email to reset your password.

### Testing Procedures

    1. Unit Testing
            -Test individual functions such as password hashing, input validation, and session management using frameworks like Jest or Mocha.
    2. Integration Testing
            -Verify that different components of the authentication system work together correctly (e.g., registration followed by login).
    3. User Acceptance Testing (UAT)
            -Conduct tests with real users to ensure that the registration and login processes are intuitive and function as expected.
    4. Security Testing
            -Perform penetration testing to identify vulnerabilities in the authentication system.
            -Test for common security issues such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and brute force attacks by simulating various attack scenarios.
    5. Performance Testing
            -Assess how well the system handles multiple simultaneous logins or registrations to ensure scalability under load.
